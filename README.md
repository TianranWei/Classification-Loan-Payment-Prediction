# Machine Learning with Python

Machine Learning with Python is an oline MOOC course autherized by IBM an provided by Coursera. This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 
In this course, there are two main components:

- First, you will be learning about the *purpose of Machine Learning* and where it applies to the real world. 

- Second, you will get *a general overview of Machine Learning topics* such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and *Machine Learning algorithms*. 

This Repo consits of my personal notes of this course and the final Project "Classification-Loan-Payment-Prediction"

In the future I'll post more my  notes and code implementation in the area such as Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Classification-Loan-Payment-Prediction

### About the Project

This Project is the final Project of this course. 

In this Project ML model should be built with KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression to predict, if a loan application will be paid off or still in collection. 

In the End we need evaluate the accuracy with jaccard similarity score,  F1 score and log loss.
